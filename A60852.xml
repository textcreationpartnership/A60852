         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some <hi>REMARKS</hi> on Captain <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill</hi>'s Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Letter, concerning a Debt Owing to one <hi>Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredas</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttredas</hi>'s Procuration and Letter to Mr. <hi>Littleton,</hi> is Dated the 15th and 19th days of <hi>January,</hi> 169<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the Bill for the Fifty Thouſand <hi>Rupees,</hi> with 12 <hi>l. per Cent, per Annum,</hi> is dated in <hi>December,</hi> 1685. To the Copy of which Bill (ſent over to Mr. <hi>Littleton,</hi>) Captain <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> Doctor <hi>Evance,</hi> and Captain <hi>Bromhill,</hi> are Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>That the Company gave <hi>Muttredas</hi> a full and ample Releaſe (the Original whereof is ready to be produced to the Honourable Houſe of Commons) in <hi>October</hi> 1685. being two Months before the borrowing of this Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rupees: So that if there were ſuch Demands by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company upon the ſaid <hi>Muttredas,</hi> as Sir <hi>John Goldsborough</hi> was pleaſed to pretend; yet the ſame are thereby diſcharged.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Muttredas</hi> ſent ſuch a Procuration to Sir <hi>Joſiah Child,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Joſiah Child</hi> made ſuch an Award, and hath now ordered ſuch, Goods to be ſent to <hi>Muttredas,</hi> as Captain <hi>Dorrill</hi> in his Anſwer aſſerts, is modeſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be what that Generous Captain hath been informed; and that may be all he intends, when he offers to make Affidavit thereto, if required; for the Company to talk big, and to vouch Hear-ſays for Truth, and believe it, is no new nor ſtrange thing.</p>
            <p>Their Confidence in laying ſuch an Account before the Honourable Houſe of Commons, wherein they reckon the Coſt of all their fifteen Ships (when they had Advice that the <hi>Thomas</hi> her Cargo was Inveſted, and ſent Home from <hi>Surratt</hi>) is ſingular, and it is no leſs, in their endeavouring to Conceal this Debt of <hi>Muttredas</hi> in <hi>Bengall,</hi> where they pretended to owe nothing, yet are now forced to own it with this pretty Evaſion.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Muttredas</hi> his Letter is to be believed, he hath not only this, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Demands upon the Company; and ſo have abundance of People more.</p>
            <p>And it will be well for all that have any thing to do with the Company, if the <hi>Martha</hi>'s Cargo Arrived in the Bay and the <hi>London</hi> Frigat's Cargo, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Fort St. <hi>George</hi> (two of the aforeſaid fifteen Ships) have not been Inveſted and ſent home from thoſe places, as was the <hi>Thomas</hi>'s from <hi>Surratt.</hi> For it's notoriouſly known, that the Company are in ſuch bad Circumſtances in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> as that they have very little either Stock or Credit there; which a Worthy Member of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, lately Arrived from thence, can Teſtifie if he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> The Debt of <hi>Muttredas,</hi> ſtands in the Company's Books, of the 30th of <hi>April,</hi> 1686. Signed by <hi>Francis Ellis,</hi> for which he is Credited in the Name of <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angee,</hi> Fifty Thouſand <hi>Rupees</hi> at Intereſt.</p>
            <p>In the Books of 1687. This Debt by Virtue of a Conſultation there, is brought from <hi>Colliangee</hi> to <hi>Muttredas</hi> his Credit, and from thence it's carried to a, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Account of <hi>Hugley</hi> Merchants; and ſo remains there, as ſo many obſolete Debts which the Company would diſcharge by ſuch like Pretences againſt thoſe Merchants, if the ſame might ſo paſs: But whoever Ingrafts upon them, will be neceſſitated (in all probability) to have the Fatiegue, Loſs, and Charge, of making up and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only the ſaid Debt to <hi>Muttredas,</hi> but all other their embroiled Debts and Accounts, in the ſeveral Places they have Traded unto in <hi>India.</hi>
